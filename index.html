        <h3 style="color: #2c7873;">Why and how I began to learn code: HTML,CSS,JavaScript-</h3>
        <p style="color: #2c7873;">Brief bio- I began to learn code, for one because of how in demand the skill is. In my continued learning, I realized this was the career path I always wanted and dreamed of! I always wanted to have a career where problem solving was a
          must and thinking how not what. I've always wanted a career where you can become so engrossed in your work you lose sleep and track of time and can't wait to get back to your project to see it through. That is my why and why I love it. If
          you're new to coding, here are some great resources I used to begin my journey.</p>
